We believe for the impossible; to truly defeat hunger and lack of child care in India by going to battle each and every day through intercession and joyfully putting our feet to action. We establish, support, and organize feeding centers, orphanages, and general care for children in need.'

We're a global community of people that believe in the power of partnering with each other and stirring our faith. We believe that Jesus didn't just die to get us into Heaven; He died to get Heaven inside of us! Let's speak life into each other. Let's speak to our mountains and tell them to move. Let's bring His Kingdom here!
